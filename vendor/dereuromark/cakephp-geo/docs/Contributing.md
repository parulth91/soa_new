# Contributing

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

I am looking forward to your contributions. There are several ways to help out:
* Write missing test cases
* Write patches for bugs/features, preferably with test cases included

There are a few guidelines that I need contributors to follow:
* Coding standards (see link below) `composer cs-check` (and `composer cs-fix` to fix)
* Passing tests (you can enable travis to assert your changes pass): `composer test`
  * Make sure you downloaded a `phpunit.phar` for this (or ran `composer setup`).
